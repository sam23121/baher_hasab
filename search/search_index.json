Bahire Hasab also known as Abushakir is a chronological system used for calculating the times of festivals and the beginning and ending of the fasting days throughout the year. The baher_hasab is a Python package that simplifies the process of working with the Bahire Hasab (also known as Abushakir) calendar. This package provides a set of tools and functions to help users easily calculate the dates of festivals and the beginning and ending of fasting days throughout the year. Key Features Calendar Conversion : Easily convert between the Gregorian calendar and the Ethiopian calendar. Festival Calculations : Automatically determine the dates of major festivals and holidays based on the Bahire Hasab calculations. Fasting Day Tracking : Effortlessly track the start and end dates of fasting periods throughout the year. Installation To install the package, you can use pip : pip install baher_hasab Usage Here's a simple example of how to use the package: from bahire_hasab import BahireHasab # Create a Bahire Hasab instance bh = BahireHasab(given_year=2016) # Get the date of a specific festival event_date = bh.get_event_date('hudade') print(event_date) # Outputs Megabit 2 Contribution Contributions to the baher_hasab package are welcome!

Initialization __init__(self, given_year: int = 2016) -> None Initializes the BaherHasab class with the given current year. Args: given_year (int): The current year in the Ethiopian calendar (7 or 8 years less than the Gregorian calendar depending on the season of the year). Example: baher_hasab = BaherHasab(given_year=2016) Baher haseb Methods get_total_years(self) -> int Calculates the total years since the creation of the world according to the Ethiopian calendar. Returns: int: The total number of years. Example: total_years = baher_hasab.get_total_years() print(total_years) # Outputs 7516 get_wember(self) -> int Calculates the Wember value for the current year. (We subtract one because the year has started, not finished). Returns: int: The Wember value. Example: wember = baher_hasab.get_wember() print(wember) # Outputs '6' get_abketa(self) -> int Calculates the Abketa value based on the Wember value. Returns: int: The Abketa value. Example: abketa = baher_hasab.get_abketa() print(abketa) # Outputs '13' get_metke(self) -> int Calculates the Metke value based on the Abketa value. Returns: int: The Metke value.
